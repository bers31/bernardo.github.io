# Student Performance Clustering Using Unsupervised Learning

This project showcases the development of a student performance clustering system using the K-Means algorithm, an unsupervised learning approach, to identify patterns and group students based on their performance. The system includes an interactive user interface built with Streamlit to provide a seamless and engaging experience for exploring the clustering results.

## Project Description

Understanding student performance is critical for educational institutions aiming to enhance learning outcomes and provide targeted interventions. This project leverages the power of K-Means clustering to analyze student data and uncover meaningful clusters. By grouping students with similar performance characteristics, educators can implement data-driven strategies to support academic success and address challenges proactively.
