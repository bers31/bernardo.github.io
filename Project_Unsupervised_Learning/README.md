# Student Performance Clustering Using Unsupervised Learning

This project showcases the development of a student performance clustering system using the K-Means algorithm, an unsupervised learning approach, to identify patterns and group students based on their performance. The system includes an interactive user interface built with Streamlit to provide a seamless and engaging experience for exploring the clustering results.

## Project Description

Understanding student performance is critical for educational institutions aiming to enhance learning outcomes and provide targeted interventions. This project leverages the power of K-Means clustering to analyze student data and uncover meaningful clusters. By grouping students with similar performance characteristics, educators can implement data-driven strategies to support academic success and address challenges proactively.

### Key Features

- **K-Means Clustering**: A robust algorithm for identifying distinct groups within student performance data based on similarities.
- **Streamlit Integration**: An interactive web-based interface for visualizing and interpreting clustering results in real time.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive handling of missing values, normalization, and feature engineering to ensure high-quality input for clustering.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Intuitive charts and graphs for exploring clusters and gaining actionable insights.
- **Actionable Insights**: Identification of clusters that represent varying levels of performance, enabling tailored interventions.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for data analysis and algorithm implementation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data exploration, preprocessing, and initial clustering model development.
- **Streamlit**: To build an interactive and user-friendly interface for cluster exploration.
