# Custom Search Engine with Vector Space Model (VSM) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)

This project is a search engine based on VSM and LSI designed to find and rank documents based on relevance. The engine can rank documents from most to least relevant by considering the semantics between words.

## Project Description
This search engine is developed to provide accurate search results by considering semantic relevance. By using VSM and LSI, this project aims to enhance the user experience in searching for information.

### Key Features
- **Relevance-Based Search**: Provides search results ranked from most to least relevant.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Uses Streamlit to display search results in an easy-to-use manner.
- **Improved Search Accuracy**: LSI improves search accuracy by up to 35% by considering the context and meaning between words.

### Technologies and Algorithms
- **Python**: For implementing VSM and LSI.
- **Streamlit**: For an interactive user interface.
- **Algorithms**:
  - **Vector Space Model (VSM)**: To measure relevance based on word frequency.
  - **Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)**: To consider semantic relationships between words and improve search relevance.

### How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. **Install Libraries**: Install the required libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Run the Streamlit Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_vsm.py
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_lsi.py
